# Learn everything

This project is forked from openAI baseline, and experimenting on reinforcement learning algorithms.

We use this repo because the interface is relatively easy to use (not really, just realtively) and several reinforcement learning algorithm is already implemented.

## Code location

All changes in this project is located in `learn2optimize` folder and a few lines in `baselines/run.py`, other folders are inherited directly from openai baseline.

## Usage

In the root directory, run `python baselines/run.py` with arguments needed.

## Installation

We would recommand installing with anaconda environment and tensorflow installed. For more details, please refer to [here](https://github.com/openai/baselines#installation)
